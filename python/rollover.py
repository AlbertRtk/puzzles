Problem:
Score = (60	â€“ (a+b+c+d+e))*F + a*ps1 + b*ps2 + c*ps3 + d*ps4 + e*ps5
Given F, ps1, ps2, ps3, ps4, ps5
Find a, b, c, d, e that maximize score
Where
a, b, c, d, e = 0 or 10
a+b+c+d+e >= 20

Solution:
Notice that
Score = 60*F + a*(ps1-F) + b*(ps2-F) + c*(ps3-F) + d*(ps4-F) + e*(ps5-F)
So we have to maximize part
max_score = a*(ps1-F) + b*(ps2-F) + c*(ps3-F) + d*(ps4-F) + e*(ps5-F)
